out. Others conversed in clusters, raising their voices over the music and the
stomping of the dancers. Ned took a wooden cup of hot cider and looked
around the room.
One group stood aloof from the dancing: the ship owner Philbert Cobley
and his family, all dressed in grey and black. The Kingsbridge Protestants
were a semi-secret group: everyone knew they were there, and could guess
who they were, but their existence was not openly acknowledged – a bit
like the half-hidden community of men who loved men, Ned thought. The
Protestants did not admit to their beliefs, for then they would be tortured
until they recanted, and burned to death if they refused. Asked what they
believed, they would prevaricate. They went to Catholic services, as they
were obliged to by law. But they took every opportunity to object to bawdy
songs, bosom-revealing gowns, and drunk priests. And there was no law
against dull clothes.
Ned knew just about everyone in the room. The younger guests were the
boys with whom he had attended Kingsbridge Grammar School and the
girls whose hair he had pulled on Sunday after church. The older generation
of local notables were equally familiar; they were in and out of his mother’s
house all the time.
In the search for Margery his eye lit on a stranger: a long-nosed man in
his late thirties, his mid-brown hair already receding, his beard neatly
trimmed in the pointed shape that was fashionable. Short and wiry, he wore
a dark red coat that was unostentatiously expensive. He was speaking to
Earl Swithin and Sir Reginald Fitzgerald, and Ned was struck by the
attitudes of the two local magnates. They clearly did not like this
distinguished visitor – Reginald leaned back with folded arms, and Swithin
stood with legs apart and hands on hips – yet they were listening to him
intently.
The musicians ended a number with a flourish, and in the relative quiet
Ned spoke to Philbert Cobley’s son, Daniel, a couple of years older than
himself, a fat boy with a pale round face. ‘Who’s that?’ Ned asked him,
pointing at the stranger in the red coat.
‘Sir William Cecil. He is estate manager for Princess Elizabeth.’
Elizabeth Tudor was the younger half-sister of Queen Mary. ‘I’ve heard
of Cecil,’ Ned said. ‘Wasn’t he secretary of state for a while?’
‘That’s right.’
At the time Ned had been too young to follow politics closely, but he
remembered the name of Cecil being mentioned with admiration by his
mother. Cecil had not been sufficiently Catholic for Mary Tudor’s taste, and
as soon as she became queen she had fired him, which was why he now had
the less grand job of looking after Elizabeth’s finances.
So what was he doing here?
Ned’s mother would want to know about Cecil. A visitor brought news,
and Alice was obsessed with news. She had always taught her sons that
information could make a man’s fortune – or save him from ruin. But as
Ned looked around for Alice he spotted Margery, and immediately forgot
about William Cecil.
He was startled by Margery’s appearance. She looked older by five years,
not one. Her curly dark hair was pinned up in an elaborate coiffure and
topped by a man’s cap with a jaunty plume. A small white ruff around her
neck seemed to light up her face. She was small, but not thin, and the
fashionably stiff bodice of her blue velvet gown did not quite conceal her
delightfully rounded figure. As always, her face was expressive. She
smiled, raised her eyebrows, tilted her head, and mimed surprise,
puzzlement, scorn and delight, one after another. He found himself staring,
just as he had in the past. For a few moments it seemed as if there was no
one else in the room.
Waking from his trance, he pushed through the crowd towards her.
She saw him coming. Her face lit up with pleasure, delighting him; then
it changed, faster than the weather on a spring day, and her expression
became clouded with worry. As he approached, her eyes widened fearfully
and she seemed to be telling him to go away, but he ignored that. He had to
speak to her.
He opened his mouth, but she spoke first. ‘Follow me when they play
Hunt the Hart,’ she said in a low voice. ‘Don’t say anything now.’
Hunt the Hart was a hide-and-seek game played by young people at
feasts. Ned was bucked by her invitation. But he was not willing to walk
away from her without at least some answers. ‘Are you in love with Bart
Shiring?’ he asked.
‘No! Now go away – we can talk later.’
Ned was thrilled, but he had not finished. ‘Are you going to marry him?’
‘Not while I have enough breath to say go to the devil.’
Ned smiled. ‘All right, now I can be patient.’ He walked away, happy.
*
ROLLO OBSERVED WITH alarm the interaction between his sister and Ned
Willard. It did not last long but it was obviously intense. Rollo was
concerned. He had been listening outside the library door yesterday, when
Margery was beaten by their father, and he agreed with his mother that
punishment just made Margery more obstinate.
He did not want his sister to marry Ned. Rollo had always disliked Ned,
but that was the least of it. More importantly, the Willards were soft on
Protestantism. Edmund Willard had been quite content when King Henry
turned against the Catholic Church. Admittedly, he had not seemed very
troubled when Queen Mary reversed the process – but that, too, offended
Rollo. He could not bear people who took religion lightly. The authority of
the Church should be everything to them.
Almost as importantly, marriage with Ned Willard would do nothing for
the prestige of the Fitzgeralds: it would merely be an alliance between two
prosperous commercial families. However, Bart Shiring would take them
into the ranks of the nobility. To Rollo, the prestige of the Fitzgerald family
mattered more than anything except the will of God.
The dancing finished, and the earl’s staff brought in boards and trestles to
make a T-shaped table, the crosspiece at one end and the tail stretching the
full length of the room; then they began to lay the table. They went about
their work in a somewhat careless spirit, Rollo thought, tossing pottery cups
and loaves of bread onto the white tablecloth haphazardly. That would be
because there was no woman in charge of the household: the countess had
died two years ago, and Swithin had not yet remarried.
A servant spoke to Rollo. ‘Your father summons you, Master Fitzgerald.
He’s in the earl’s parlour.’
The man led Rollo into a side room with a writing table and a shelf of
ledgers, evidently the place where Earl Swithin conducted business.
Swithin sat on a huge chair that was almost a throne. He was tall and
handsome, like Bart, though many years of eating well and drinking plenty
had thickened his waist and reddened his nose. Four years ago he had lost
most of the fingers of his left hand in the battle of Hartley Wood. He made
no attempt to conceal the deficiency – in fact, he seemed proud of his
wound.
Rollo’s father, Sir Reginald, sat next to Swithin, lean and freckled, a
leopard beside a bear.
Bart Shiring was there, too, and to Rollo’s consternation so were Alice
and Ned Willard.
William Cecil was on a low stool in front of the six local people but,
despite the symbolism of the seating, it looked to Rollo as if Cecil was in
charge of the meeting.
Reginald said to Cecil: ‘You won’t mind my son joining us? He has been
to Oxford University, and studied law at the Inns of Court in London.’
‘I’m glad to have the younger generation here,’ Cecil said amiably. ‘I
include my own son in meetings, even though he’s only sixteen – the earlier
they begin, the faster they learn.’
Studying Cecil, Rollo noticed that there were three warts on his right
cheek, and his brown beard was beginning to turn grey. He had been a
powerful courtier during the reign of Edward VI, while still in his twenties,
and although he was not yet forty years old he had an air of confident
wisdom that might have belonged to a much older man.
Earl Swithin shifted impatiently. ‘I have a hundred guests in the hall, Sir
William. You’d better tell me what you have to say that is important enough
to take me away from my own party.’
‘At once, my lord,’ Cecil said. ‘The queen is not pregnant.’
Rollo let out a grunt of surprise and dismay.
Queen Mary and King Felipe were desperate for heirs to their two
crowns, England and Spain. But they spent hardly any time together, being
so busy ruling their widely separated kingdoms. So there had been rejoicing
in both countries when Mary had announced that she was expecting a baby
next March. Obviously something had gone wrong.
Rollo’s father, Sir Reginald, said grimly: ‘This has happened before.’
Cecil nodded. ‘It is her second false pregnancy.’
Swithin looked bewildered. ‘False?’ he said. ‘What do you mean?’
‘There has been no miscarriage,’ Cecil said solemnly.
Reginald explained: ‘She wants a baby so badly, she convinces herself
that she’s expecting when she’s not.’
‘I see,’ said Swithin. ‘Female stupidity.’
Alice Willard gave a contemptuous snort at this remark, but Swithin was
oblivious.
Cecil said: ‘We must now face the likelihood that our queen will never
give birth to a child.’
Rollo’s mind was awhirl with the consequences. The longed-for child of
the ultra-Catholic Queen Mary and the equally devout King of Spain would
have been raised strictly Catholic, and could have been relied upon to
favour families such as the Fitzgeralds. But if Mary should die without an
heir, all bets were off.
Cecil had figured this out long ago, Rollo assumed. Cecil said: ‘The
transition to a new monarch is a time of danger for any country.’
Rollo had to suppress a feeling of panic. England could return to
Protestantism – and everything the Fitzgerald family had achieved in the
last five years could be wiped out.
‘I want to plan for a smooth succession, with no bloodshed,’ Cecil said in
a tone of reasonableness. ‘I’m here to speak to you three powerful
provincial leaders – the earl of the county, the mayor of Kingsbridge, and
the town’s leading merchant – and to ask you to help me.’
He sounded deceptively like a diligent servant making careful plans, but
Rollo could already see that he was, in fact, a dangerous revolutionary.
Swithin said: ‘And how would we help you?’
‘By pledging support for my mistress, Elizabeth.’
Swithin said challengingly: ‘You assume that Elizabeth is heir to the
throne?’
‘Henry the Eighth left three children,’ Cecil said pedantically, stating the
obvious. ‘His son, Edward the Sixth, the boy king, died before he could
produce an heir, so Henry’s elder daughter, Mary Tudor, became queen. The
logic is inescapable. If Queen Mary dies childless, as King Edward did, the
next in line to the throne is clearly Henry’s other daughter, Elizabeth
Tudor.’
Rollo decided it was time to speak. This dangerous nonsense could not be
allowed to pass unchallenged, and he was the only lawyer in the room. He
tried to speak as quietly and as rationally as Cecil but, despite the effort, he
could hear the note of alarm in his own voice. ‘Elizabeth is illegitimate!’ he
said. ‘Henry was never truly married to her mother. His divorce from his
previous wife was disallowed by the Pope.’
Swithin added: ‘Bastards cannot inherit property or titles – everyone
knows that.’
Rollo winced. Calling Elizabeth a bastard was unnecessary rudeness to
her counsellor. Coarse manners were typical of Swithin, unfortunately. But
it was rash, Rollo felt, to antagonize the self-possessed Cecil. The man
might be out of favour, but still he had an air of quiet potency.
Cecil overlooked the incivility. ‘The divorce was ratified by the English
parliament,’ he said with polite insistence.
Swithin said: ‘I hear she has Protestant leanings.’
That was the heart of it, Rollo thought.
Cecil smiled. ‘She has told me, many times, that if she should become
queen, it is her dearest wish that no Englishman should lose his life for the
sake of his beliefs.’
Ned Willard spoke up. ‘That’s a good sign,’ he said. ‘No one wants to see
more people burned at the stake.’
That was typical of the Willards, Rollo thought: anything for a quiet life.
Earl Swithin was equally irritated by the equivocation. ‘Catholic or
Protestant?’ he said. ‘She must be one or the other.’
‘On the contrary,’ Cecil said, ‘her creed is tolerance.’
Swithin was indignant. ‘Tolerance?’ he said scornfully. ‘Of heresy?
Blasphemy? Godlessness?’
Swithin’s outrage was justified, in Rollo’s opinion, but it was no
substitute for legal argument. The Catholic Church had its own view on
who should be the next ruler of England. ‘In the eyes of the world, the true
heir to the throne is the other Mary, the queen of the Scots.’
‘Surely not,’ Cecil argued, clearly having expected this. ‘Mary Stuart is
no more than the grand-niece of King Henry VIII, whereas Elizabeth Tudor
is his daughter.’
‘His illegitimate daughter.’
Ned Willard spoke again. ‘I saw Mary Stuart when I went to Paris,’ he
said. ‘I didn’t talk to her, but I was in one of the outer rooms of the Louvre
Palace when she passed through. She is tall and beautiful.’
Rollo said impatiently: ‘What’s that got to do with anything?’
Ned persisted. ‘She’s fifteen years old.’ He looked hard at Rollo. ‘The
same age as your sister, Margery.’
‘That’s not the point—’
Ned raised his voice to override the interruption. ‘Some people think a
girl of fifteen is too young to choose a husband, let alone rule a country.’
Rollo drew in his breath sharply, and his father gave a grunt of
indignation. Cecil frowned, no doubt realizing that Ned’s statement had a
special meaning hidden from an outsider.
Ned added: ‘I was told that Mary speaks French and Scotch, but she has
hardly any English.’
Rollo said: ‘Such considerations have no weight in law.’
Ned persisted. ‘But there’s worse. Mary is engaged to marry Prince
Francis, the heir to the French throne. The English people dislike our
present queen’s marriage to the King of Spain, and they will be even more
hostile to a queen who marries the King of France.’
Rollo said: ‘Such decisions are not made by the English people.’
‘All the same, where there is doubt there may be fighting, and then the
people may pick up their scythes and their axes and make their opinions
known.’
Cecil put in: ‘And that’s exactly what I’m trying to prevent.’
That was actually a threat, Rollo noted angrily; but before he could say
so, Swithin spoke again. ‘What is this girl Elizabeth like, personally? I’ve
never met her.’
Rollo frowned in irritation at this diversion from the question of
legitimacy, but Cecil answered willingly. ‘She is the best-educated woman I
have ever met,’ he said. ‘She can converse in Latin as easily as in English,
and she also speaks French, Spanish and Italian, and writes Greek. She is
not thought to be a great beauty, but she has a way of enchanting a man so
that he thinks her lovely. She has inherited the strength of will of her father,
King Henry. She will make a decisive sovereign.’
Cecil was obviously in love with her, Rollo thought; but that was not the
worst of it. Elizabeth’s opponents had to rely on legalistic arguments
because there was little else for them to take hold of. It seemed that
Elizabeth was old enough, wise enough, and strong-minded enough to rule
England. She might be a Protestant, but she was too clever to flaunt it, and
they had no proof.
The prospect of a Protestant queen horrified Rollo. She would surely
disfavour Catholic families. The Fitzgeralds might never recover their
fortunes.
Swithin said: ‘Now, if she were to marry a strong Catholic husband who
could keep her under control, she might be more acceptable.’ He chuckled
lasciviously, making Rollo suppress a shudder. Clearly Swithin was aroused
by the thought of keeping a princess under control.
‘I’ll bear that in mind,’ said Cecil drily. A bell rang to tell the guests to
take their places at table, and he stood up. ‘All I ask is that you don’t rush to
judgement. Give Princess Elizabeth a chance.’
Reginald and Rollo hung back when the others left the room. Reginald
said: ‘I think we set him straight.’
Rollo shook his head. There were times when he wished his father’s
mind were more devious. ‘Cecil knew, before he came here, that loyal
Catholics such as you and Swithin would never pledge support for
Elizabeth.’
‘I suppose he did,’ said Reginald. ‘He’s nothing if not well informed.’
‘And he’s evidently a clever man.’
‘Then why is he here?’
‘I’ve been wondering about that,’ said Rollo. ‘I think he came to assess
the strength of his enemies.’
‘Oh,’ said his father. ‘I never thought of that.’
‘Let’s go in to dinner,’ said Rollo.
*
NED WAS RESTLESS all through the banquet. He could hardly wait for the
eating and drinking to end so that the game of Hunt the Hart could begin.
But just as the sweets were being cleared away, his mother caught his eye
and beckoned him.
He had noticed that she was deep in conversation with Sir William Cecil.
Alice Willard was a vigorous, tubby woman, wearing a costly dress of
Kingsbridge Scarlet embroidered with gold thread, and a medallion of the
Virgin Mary around her neck to ward off accusations of Protestantism. Ned
was tempted to pretend that he had not seen her summons. The game would
take place while the tables were being cleared and the actors were getting
ready to perform the play. Ned was not sure what Margery had in mind but,
whatever it was, he was not going to miss it. However, his mother was strict
as well as loving, and she would not tolerate disobedience, so he went to
her side.
‘Sir William wants to ask you a few questions,’ Alice said.
‘I’m honoured,’ Ned said politely.
‘I want to know about Calais,’ Cecil began. ‘I gather you’ve just returned
from there.’
‘I left a week before Christmas, and got here yesterday.’
‘I need hardly tell you and your mother how vital the city is to English
commerce. It’s also a matter of national pride that we still rule a small part
of France.’
Ned nodded. ‘And deeply annoying to the French, of course.’
‘How is the morale of the English community there?’
‘Fine,’ said Ned, but he began to worry. Cecil was not interrogating him
out of idle curiosity: there was a reason. And, now that he thought about it,
his mother’s face looked grim. But he carried on. ‘When I left, they were
still rejoicing over the defeat of the French at St Quentin back in August.
That made them feel that the war between England and France was not
going to affect them.’
‘Over-confident, perhaps,’ Cecil muttered.
Ned frowned. ‘Calais is surrounded by forts: Sangatte, Fréthun, Nielles
—’
Cecil interrupted him. ‘And if the fortresses should fall?’
‘The city has three hundred and seven cannons.’
‘You have a good mind for details. But can the people withstand a siege?’
‘They have food for three months.’ Ned had made sure of his facts before
leaving, for he had known that his mother would expect a detailed report.
He turned to Alice now. ‘What’s happened, Mother?’
Alice said: ‘The French took Sangatte on the first day of January.’
Ned was shocked. ‘How could that happen?’
Cecil answered that question. ‘The French army was assembled in great
secrecy in nearby towns. The attack took the Calais garrison by surprise.’
‘Who leads the French forces?’
‘François, duke of Guise.’
‘Scarface!’ said Ned. ‘He’s a legend.’ The duke was France’s greatest
general.
‘By now the city must be under siege.’
‘But it has not fallen.’
‘So far as we know, but my latest news is five days old.’
Ned turned to Alice again. ‘No word from Uncle Dick?’
Alice shook her head. ‘He cannot get a message out of a besieged city.’
Ned thought of his relations there: Aunt Blanche, a much better cook
than Janet Fife, though Ned would never tell Janet that; cousin Albin, who
was his age and had taught him the French words for intimate parts of the
body and other unmentionable things; and amorous Thérèse. Would they
survive?
Alice said quietly: ‘Almost everything we have is tied up in Calais.’
Ned frowned. Was that possible? He said: ‘Don’t we have any cargoes
going to Seville?’
The Spanish port of Seville was the armoury of King Felipe, with an
insatiable appetite for metal. A cousin of Ned’s father, Carlos Cruz, bought
as much as Alice could send, turning it all into cannons and cannonballs for
Spain’s interminable wars. Ned’s brother, Barney, who was in Seville, was
living and working with Carlos, learning another side of the family
business, as Ned had done in Calais. But the sea journey was long and
hazardous, and ships were sent there only when the much nearer warehouse
at Calais was full.
Alice replied to Ned’s question: ‘No. At the moment we have no ships
going to or from Seville.’
‘So if we lose Calais . . .’
‘We lose almost everything.’
Ned had thought he understood the business, but he had not realized that
it could be ruined so quickly. He felt as he did when a trustworthy horse
stumbled and shifted under him, making him lose his balance in the saddle.
It was a sudden reminder that life was unpredictable.
A bell was rung for the start of the game. Cecil smiled and said: ‘Thank
you for your information, Ned. It’s unusual for young men to be so precise.’
Ned was flattered. ‘I’m glad to have been of help.’
Dan Cobley’s pretty, golden-haired sister, Ruth, passed by saying: ‘Come
on, Ned, it’s time for Hunt the Hart.’
‘Coming,’ he said, but he did not move. He felt torn. He was desperate to
talk to Margery, but after news like this he was in no mood for a game. ‘I
suppose there’s nothing we can do,’ he said to his mother.
‘Just wait for more information – which may be a long time coming.’
There was a gloomy pause. Cecil said: ‘By the way, I’m looking for an
assistant to help me in my work for the lady Elizabeth; a young man to live
at Hatfield Palace as part of her staff, and to act on my behalf when I have
to be in London, or elsewhere. I know your destiny is to work with your
mother in the family business, Ned, but if you should happen to know a
young man a bit like yourself, intelligent and trustworthy, with a sharp eye
for detail . . . let me know.’
Ned nodded. ‘Of course.’ He suspected that Cecil was really offering the
job to him.
Cecil went on: ‘He would have to share Elizabeth’s tolerant attitude to
religion.’ Queen Mary Tudor had burned hundreds of Protestants at the
stake.
Ned certainly felt that way, as Cecil must have realized during the
argument in the earl’s library about the succession to the throne. Millions of
English people agreed: whether Catholic or Protestant, they were sickened
by the slaughter.
‘As I said earlier, Elizabeth has told me many times that if she should
become queen, it is her dearest wish that no Englishman should lose his life
for the sake of his beliefs,’ Cecil repeated. ‘I think that’s an ideal worthy of
a man’s faith.’
Alice looked mildly resentful. ‘As you say, Sir William, my sons are
destined to work in the family business. Off you go, Ned.’
Ned turned around and looked for Margery.
*
EARL SWITHIN HAD hired a travelling company of actors, and now they were
building a raised platform up against one long wall of the great hall. While
Margery was watching them, Lady Brecknock stood beside her and did the
same. An attractive woman in her late thirties with a warm smile, Susannah
Brecknock was a cousin of Earl Swithin’s, and was a frequent visitor to
Kingsbridge, where she had a house. Margery had met her before and found
her amiable and not too grand.
The stage was made of planks on barrels. Margery said: ‘It looks a bit
shaky.’
‘That’s what I thought!’ said Susannah.
‘Do you know what they’re going to perform?’
‘The life of Mary Magdalene.’
‘Oh!’ Mary Magdalene was the patron saint of prostitutes. Priests always
corrected this by saying: ‘Reformed prostitutes,’ but that did not make the
saint any less intriguing. ‘But how can they? All the actors are men.’
‘You haven’t seen a play before?’
‘Not this kind, with a stage and professional players. I’ve just seen
processions and pageants.’
‘The female characters are always played by men. They don’t allow
women to act.’
‘Why not?’
‘Oh, I expect it’s because we’re inferior beings, physically weak and
intellectually feeble.’
She was being sarcastic. Margery liked Susannah for the candid way she
talked. Most adults responded to embarrassing questions with empty
platitudes, but Susannah could be relied upon to tell the plain truth.
Emboldened, Margery blurted out what was on her mind: ‘Did they force
you to marry the Lord Brecknock?’
Susannah raised her eyebrows.
Margery realized immediately that she had gone too far. Quickly she
said: ‘I’m so sorry, I have no right to ask you that, please forgive me.’ Tears
came to her eyes.
Susannah shrugged. ‘You certainly do not have the right to ask me such a
question, but I haven’t forgotten what it was like to be fifteen.’ She lowered
her voice. ‘Who do they want you to marry?’
‘Bart Shiring.’
‘Oh, God, poor you,’ she said, even though Bart was her second cousin.
Her sympathy made Margery feel even more sorry for herself. Susannah
thought for a minute. ‘It’s no secret that my marriage was arranged, but no
one forced me,’ she said. ‘I met him and liked him.’
‘Do you love him?’
She hesitated again, and Margery could see that she was torn between
discretion and compassion. ‘I shouldn’t answer that.’
‘No, of course not, I apologize – again.’
‘But I can see that you’re in distress, so I’ll confide in you, provided you
promise never to repeat what I say.’
‘I promise.’
‘Brecknock and I are friends,’ she said. ‘He’s kind to me and I do
everything I can to please him. And we have four wonderful children. I am
happy.’ She paused, and Margery waited for the answer to her question. At
last Susannah said: ‘But I know there is another kind of happiness, the mad
ecstasy of adoring someone and being adored in return.’
‘Yes!’ Margery was so glad that Susannah understood.
‘That particular joy is not given to all of us,’ she said solemnly.
‘But it should be!’ Margery could not bear the thought that a person
might be denied love.
For a moment, Susannah looked bereft. ‘Perhaps,’ she said quietly.
‘Perhaps.’
Looking over Susannah’s shoulder, Margery saw Ned approaching in his
green French doublet. Susannah followed her look. Perceptively she said:
‘Ned Willard is the one you want?’
‘Yes.’
‘Good choice. He’s nice.’
‘He’s wonderful.’
Susannah smiled with a touch of sadness. ‘I hope it works out for you.’
Ned bowed to her, and she acknowledged him with a nod but moved
away.
The actors were hanging a curtain across one corner of the room.
Margery said to Ned: ‘What do you think that’s for?’
‘They will put on their costumes behind the curtain, I think.’ He lowered
his voice. ‘When can we talk? I can’t wait much longer.’
‘The game is about to begin. Just follow me.’
Philbert Cobley’s good-looking clerk, Donal Gloster, was chosen to be
hunter. He had wavy dark hair and a sensual face. He did not appeal to
Margery – too weak – but several of the girls would be hoping to be found
by him, she felt sure.
New Castle was the perfect location for the game. It had more secret
places than a rabbit warren. The parts where the new mansion was joined to
the old castle were especially rich in odd cupboards, unexpected staircases,
niches and irregular-shaped rooms. It was a children’s game and Margery,
when young, had wondered why nineteen-year-olds were so keen to join in.
Now she understood that the game was an opportunity for adolescents to
kiss and cuddle.
Donal closed his eyes and began to say the paternoster in Latin, and all
the young people scattered to hide.
Margery already knew where she was going, for she had scouted hideyholes
earlier, to be sure of a private place in which to talk to Ned. She left
the hall and raced along a corridor towards the rooms of the old castle,
trusting to Ned to follow her. She went through a door at the end of the
corridor.
Glancing back, she saw Ned – and, unfortunately, several others. That
was a nuisance: she wanted him to herself.
She passed through a small storeroom and ran up a twisting staircase
with stone steps, then down a short flight. She could hear the others behind
her, but she was now out of their sight. She turned into a passageway she
knew to be a dead end. It was lit by a single candle in a wall bracket.
Halfway along was a huge fireplace: the medieval bakery, long disused, its
chimney demolished in the building of the modern house. Beside it,
concealed by a stone buttress, was the door to the enormous oven, virtually
invisible in the dimness. Margery slipped into the oven, pulling her skirts
behind her. It was surprisingly clean, she had noted when scouting. She
pulled the door almost shut and peeped through a crack.
Ned came charging along the passageway, closely followed by Bart, then
pretty Ruth Cobley, who probably had her eye on Bart. Margery groaned in
frustration. How could she separate Ned from the others?
They dashed past the oven without seeing the door. A moment later,
having run into the dead end, they returned in reverse order: Ruth, then
Bart, then Ned.
Margery saw her chance.
Bart and Ruth disappeared from view, and Margery said: ‘Ned!’
He stopped and looked around, puzzled.
She pushed open the oven door. ‘In here!’
He did not need to be asked twice. He scrambled in with her and she shut
the door.
It was pitch-dark, but they were lying knee to knee and chin to chin, and
she could feel the length of his body. He kissed her.
She kissed him back hungrily. Whatever else happened, he still loved her,
and for the moment that was all she cared about. She had been afraid that he
would forget her in Calais. She thought he would meet French girls who
were more sophisticated and exciting than little Marge Fitzgerald from
Kingsbridge. But he had not, she could tell, from the way he hugged and
kissed and caressed her. Overjoyed, she put her hands on his head and
opened her mouth to his tongue and arched her body against his.
He rolled on top of her. At that moment, she would have opened her body
to him gladly and let him take her virginity, but something happened. There
was a thump, as if his foot had struck something, then a noise that might
have been a panel of wood falling to the ground and suddenly she could see
the walls of the oven around her.
She and Ned were both sufficiently startled to stop what they were doing
and look up. They saw that the back of the oven had fallen away. Clearly it
connected with another place that was dimly lit and Margery realized with
trepidation that there might be people there who could see what she and
Ned were doing. She sat upright and looked through the hole.
There was no one in sight. She saw a wall with an arrow-slit window that
was admitting the last of the afternoon light. A small space behind the old
oven had simply been closed off by the building of the new house. It led
nowhere: the only access was through the oven. On the floor was a panel of
wood that must have closed up the hole until Ned kicked it in his
excitement. Margery could hear voices, but they came from the courtyard
outside. She breathed more easily: they had not been seen.
She crawled through the hole and stood upright in the little space. Ned
followed her. They both looked around wonderingly, and Ned said: ‘We
could stay here for ever.’
That brought Margery back to reality, and she realized how close she had
come to committing a mortal sin. Desire had almost overwhelmed her
knowledge of right and wrong. She had had a lucky escape.
Her intention in bringing Ned here had been to speak to him, not kiss
him. She said: ‘Ned, they want to make me marry Bart. What are we going
to do?’
‘I don’t know,’ said Ned.

SWITHIN WAS quite drunk, Rollo saw. The earl was slumped on a big chair
opposite the stage, a goblet in his right hand. A young serving girl refilled
his glass, and as she did so he grasped her breast with his maimed left hand.
She squealed with horror and pulled away, spilling the wine, and Swithin
laughed.
An actor came on stage and began a prologue, explaining that in order to
tell a story of repentance it was necessary first to show the sin, and
apologizing in advance if this should give offence.
Rollo saw his sister Margery come slinking into the room with Ned
Willard, and he frowned in disapproval. They had taken advantage of the
game of Hunt the Hart to go off together, Rollo realized, and no doubt they
had got up to all kinds of mischief.
Rollo did not understand his sister. She took religion very seriously, but
she had always been disobedient. How could that be? For Rollo, the essence
of religion was submission to authority. That was the trouble with
Protestants: they thought they had the right to make up their own minds.
But Margery was a devout Catholic.
On stage a character called Infidelity appeared, identifiable by his
oversized codpiece. He winked and spoke behind his hand and looked from
left to right as if making sure he was not overheard by any other characters.
The audience laughed as they recognized an exaggerated version of a type
they all knew.
Rollo had been unnerved by the conversation with Sir William Cecil, but
now he thought he might have overreacted. Princess Elizabeth probably was
a Protestant, but it was too soon to worry about her: after all, Queen Mary
Tudor was only forty-one and in good health, apart from the phantom
pregnancies – she could reign for decades more.
Mary Magdalene appeared on stage. Clearly this was the saint before her
repentance. She sashayed on in a red dress, fussing with her necklace,
batting her eyes at Infidelity. Her lips were reddened with some kind of dye.
Rollo was surprised because he had not seen a woman among the actors.
Furthermore, although he had not seen a play before, he was pretty sure
women were not allowed to act. The company had appeared to consist of
four men and a boy of about thirteen. Rollo frowned at Mary Magdalene,
puzzled; then it occurred to him that she was the same size and build as the
boy.
The truth began to dawn on the audience, and there were murmurs of
admiration and surprise. But Rollo also heard low but clear noises of protest
and, looking around, he saw that they came from the corner where Philbert
Cobley stood with his family. Catholics were relaxed about plays, provided
there was a religious message, but some of the ultra-Protestants
disapproved. A boy dressed as a woman was just the kind of thing to make
them righteously indignant, especially when the female character was
acting sexy. They were all stony-faced – with one exception, Rollo noticed:
Philbert’s bright young clerk, Donal Gloster, who was laughing as heartily
as anyone. Rollo and all the young people in town knew that Donal was in
love with Philbert’s fair daughter, Ruth. Rollo guessed that Donal was
Protestant only to win Ruth.
On stage, Infidelity took Mary in his arms and gave her a long, lascivious
kiss. This caused uproarious laughter, hoots and catcalls, especially from
the young men, who had by now figured out that Mary was a boy.
But Philbert Cobley did not see the joke. He was a beefy man, short but
wide, with thinning hair and a straggly beard. Now he was red in the face,
waving his fist and shouting something that could not be heard. At first no
one paid him any attention, but when at last the actors broke the kiss and
the laughter died down, people turned to look at the source of the shouting.
Rollo saw Earl Swithin suddenly notice the kerfuffle and look angry.
Here comes trouble, Rollo thought.
Philbert stopped shouting, said something to the people around him, and
moved towards the door. His family fell in behind him. Donal went along
too, but Rollo saw that he looked distinctly disappointed.
Swithin got up from his chair and walked towards them. ‘You stay where
you are!’ he roared. ‘I gave no one permission to leave.’
The actors paused and turned to watch what was going on in the
audience, a reversal of roles that Rollo found ironic.
Philbert stopped, turned, and shouted back at Swithin: ‘We will not stay
in this palace of Sodom!’ Then he continued marching towards the door.
‘You preening Protestant!’ Swithin yelled, and he ran at Philbert.
Swithin’s son, Bart, stepped into his father’s way, holding up a placatory
hand, and yelled: ‘Let them go, Father, they’re not worth it.’
Swithin swept him aside with a powerful shove and fell on Philbert. ‘I’ll
kill you, by the cross!’ He grabbed him by the throat and began to strangle
him. Philbert dropped to his knees and Swithin bent over him, tightening
his grip despite his maimed left hand.
Everybody began to shout at once. Several men and women pulled at
Swithin’s sleeves, trying to get him away from Philbert, but they were
constrained by fear of hurting an earl, even one bent on murder. Rollo
stayed back, not caring whether Philbert lived or died.
Ned Willard was the first to act decisively. He hooked his right arm
around Swithin’s neck, getting the crook of his elbow under the earl’s chin,
and heaved up and back. Swithin could not help but step away and release
his hold on Philbert’s neck.
Ned had always been like this, Rollo recalled. Even when he was a
cheeky little boy at school he had been a fierce fighter, ready to defy older
boys, and Rollo had been obliged to teach him a lesson or two with a
bundle of birch twigs. Then Ned had matured and grown those big hands
and feet; and, even though he was still shorter than average, bigger boys
had learned to respect his fists.
Now Ned released Swithin and smartly stepped away, becoming one of
the crowd again. Roaring with fury, Swithin spun around, looking for his
assailant, but could not tell who it had been. He might find out, eventually,
Rollo guessed, but by then he would be sober.
Philbert got to his feet, rubbing his neck, and staggered to the door
unobserved by Swithin.
Bart grabbed his father’s arm. ‘Let’s have another cup of wine and watch
the play,’ he said. ‘In a minute Carnal Concupiscence comes on.’
Philbert and his entourage reached the door.
Swithin stared angrily at Bart for a long moment. He seemed to have
forgotten whom he was supposed to be mad at.
The Cobleys left the room and the big oak door slammed shut behind
them.
Swithin shouted: ‘On with the play!’
The actors resumed.

Pierre Aumande made his living by relieving Parisians of their excess cash,
a task that became easier on days like today, when they were celebrating.
All Paris was rejoicing. A French army had conquered Calais, taking the
city back from the English barbarians who had somehow stolen it two
hundred years ago. In every taproom in the capital men were drinking the
health of Scarface, the duke of Guise, the great general who had erased the
ancient stain on the nation’s pride.
The tavern of St Étienne, in the neighbourhood called Les Halles, was no
exception. At one end of the room a small crowd of young men played dice,
toasting Scarface every time someone won. By the door was a table of menat-
arms celebrating as if they had taken Calais themselves. In a corner a
prostitute had passed out at a table, hair soaking in a puddle of wine.
Such festivities presented golden opportunities to a man such as Pierre.
He was a student at the Sorbonne university. He told his fellows that he
got a generous allowance from his parents back home in the Champagne
region. In fact, his father gave him nothing. His mother had spent her lifesavings
on a new outfit of clothes for him to wear to Paris, and now she was
penniless. It was assumed that he would support himself by clerical work
such as copying legal documents, as many students did. But Pierre’s
openhanded spending on the pleasures of the city was paid for by other
means. Today he was wearing a fashionable doublet in blue cloth slashed to
show the white silk lining beneath: such clothes could not be paid for even
by a year of copying documents.
He was watching the game of dice. The gamblers were the sons of
prosperous citizens, he guessed; jewellers and lawyers and builders. One of
them, Bertrand, was cleaning up. At first Pierre suspected that Bertrand was
a trickster just like himself, and observed carefully, trying to figure out how
the dodge was done. But eventually he decided there was no scam. Bertrand
was simply enjoying a run of luck.
And that gave Pierre his chance.
When Bertrand had won a little more than fifty livres his friends left the
tavern with empty pockets. Bertrand called for a bottle of wine and a round
of cheese, and at that point Pierre moved in.
‘My grandfather’s cousin was lucky, like you,’ he said in the tone of
relaxed amiability that had served him well in the past. ‘When he gambled,
he won. He fought at Marignano and survived.’ Pierre was making this up
as he went along. ‘He married a poor girl, because she was beautiful and he
loved her, then she inherited a mill from an uncle. His son became a
bishop.’
‘I’m not always lucky.’
Bertrand was not completely stupid, Pierre thought, but he was probably
dumb enough. ‘I bet there was a girl who seemed not to like you until one
day she kissed you.’ Most men had this experience during their
adolescence, he had found.
But Bertrand thought Pierre’s insight was amazing. ‘Yes!’ he said.
‘Clothilde – how did you know?’
‘I told you, you’re lucky.’ He leaned closer and spoke in a lower voice, as
if confiding a secret. ‘One day, when my grandfather’s cousin was old, a
beggar told him the secret of his good fortune.’
Bertrand could not resist. ‘What was it?’
‘The beggar said to him: “When your mother was expecting you, she
gave a penny to me – and that’s why you’ve been lucky all your life.” It’s
the truth.’
Bertrand looked disappointed.
Pierre raised a finger in the air, like a conjurer about to perform a magic
trick. ‘Then the beggar threw off his filthy robes and revealed himself to be
– an angel!’
Bertrand was half sceptical, half awestruck.
‘The angel blessed my grandfather’s cousin, then flew up to heaven.’
Pierre lowered his voice to a whisper. ‘I think your mother gave alms to an
angel.’
Bertrand, who was not completely drunk, said: ‘Maybe.’
‘Is your mother kind?’ Pierre asked, knowing that few men would answer
‘No’.
‘She is like a saint.’
‘There you are.’ Pierre thought for a moment of his own mother, and how
disappointed she would be if she knew that he was living by cheating
people out of their money. Bertrand is asking for it, he told her in his
imagination; he’s a gambler and a drunk. But the excuse did not satisfy her,
even in his fantasy.
He pushed the thought from his mind. This was not the time for selfdoubt:
Bertrand was beginning to take the bait.
Pierre went on: ‘There was an older man – not your father – who gave
you important advice at least once.’
Bertrand’s eyes widened in surprise. ‘I never knew why Monsieur
Larivière was so helpful.’
‘He was sent by your angel. Have you ever had a narrow escape from
injury or death?’
‘I got lost when I was five years old. I decided that my way home was
across the river. I almost drowned, but a passing friar saved me.’
‘That was no friar, that was your angel.’
‘It’s amazing – you’re right!’
‘Your mother did something for an angel in disguise, and that angel has
watched over you ever since. I know it.’
Pierre accepted a cup of wine and a wedge of cheese. Free food was
always welcome.
He was studying for the priesthood because it was a way up the social
ladder. But he had been at the university only a few days when he realized
tha
